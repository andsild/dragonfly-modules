# TODO
* ~~refactor "grammars/generic_edit.py" into several different files instead of one giant mess~~
* ~~Currently, the scripts in "utility" cannot be reloaded without restarting DNS! gotta fix that.~~
* ~~some sort of log for every command would be sooo nice.~~
* ~~follow-up of item above: ability to "undo previous voice command" would be great. It can be simple, like just trying to undo text with backspace, e.g. "chook command"~~
* Consider pylinting all of the code just to keep it smooth
* Actually start using grammars.... lol
* Fix context sensitive grammars
